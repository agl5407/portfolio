        <h3>The most significant challenges for a new learner, like me, was to figure out all of the different elements involved in HTML. I have never worked with coding or anything like this, so learning ws very difficult. I learned that taking notes of the different elements made a big difference in helping me learn.I think an advantage is learning the different elements and vocabulary of HTML.</h3>
        
        <h3>There are many challenges faced when learning how to create a website. It was very difficult for me to learn all of the different elements and codes. Figuring out how to organize each site was also difficult.</h3>
        <h3>There are many skills to learn and develop these sites. I learned that taking notes can help you with learning the elements. So, when you're not sure what to put, you are able to look back onto your notes.</h3>
        <h3>I think I want to learn more about the organization of the sites. I was unable to figure out certain things throughout this project</h3>
